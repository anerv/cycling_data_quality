# TO-DO

- switch to american english
- title in all notebooks
- print - create network... adapt - successfully
- update readme numbering of notebooks
- update summary descriptions
- save all plots to files?
- report generation
- data folder structure (folder name study area, parameter)
- graphml - more lightweight format
- readme - provide a polygon - config - provide formats
- recommend max study area size - refer to pyrosm for bigger areas
- create bash setup script file
- plot prob length of network components
- complementary probability function
- average node degree - max node degree - consider cutting it
- pct diff calculations in summary notebooks - -100%

## README

- illustration of workflow

## Case Studies

- Run the analysis on 2 areas/2 reference datasets
- Make separate copies of all notebooks with results
- save folium plots and display them
- Add GeoDanmark attribution to all maps with reference example data!

## Random

m1.save("exercise09_example_tesselation.html")
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='exercise09_example_tesselation.html', width=900, height=700)

## Paper

- Output
- Case studies
- Abstract
- Figures

## SMALL THINGS

- unconnected --> disconnected
- connected component first time, after than just components
- cycling --> bicycle
