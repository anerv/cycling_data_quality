# Questions to be answered in the analysis

## Completeness

- **Density of nodes/edges/attributes (possibly grid-cell based?)**
- **If reference data set available: How 'much' of an area's cycling infrastructure is mapped?**
- Total length/total length of different types of infrastructure
- Development in contributions (spatial heterogeneity!)

## Quality

- **How well is it mapped?**
- Customized simplification: tag diversity; parallel edges etc.
- Differences in network structure
- Differences in routing
- Matching of data sets
- Missing tags
- Number of contributors
- Contribution history

## Regional/local differences

- Point out areas that are possibly more "interesting": e.g. where number of edits is especially high/low, where number of contributors is high/low, where data sets differ strongly (include also: where infrastructure is more sparse?)

## Interpretation and Presentation of results

- Analysis of identified errors/inconsistencies - e.g. spatial clustering/autocorrelation - is there a tendency?
- Autogenerated summary and plots
- e.g. generate a PDF - each page contains a figure and an explanatory text. or keep it in notebook only

# TO-DO

## README

- add about reference data split to smallest linestring **SUNDAY**

## Config

## Load data

## 2*Intrinsinc Notebooks

- change colors
- comments on how differences are computed
- NA plotting
- check pct calculations

## Extrinsic Notebooks

- change colors
- comments on how differences are computed
- NA plotting
- check pct calculations

- local node/edge ratio --> local average degree **SUNDAY**
    - including explanation

- delete part on cells with more than one component?

## Feature Matching Notebook

- change colors
- comments on how differences are computed
- NA plotting
- check pct calculations

## Summary of findings

- change colors
- comments on how differences are computed
- NA plotting
- check pct calculations

- edge/node ratio --> avg degree **SUNDAY**

- export as pdf?


## Case Studies

- Run the analysis on 2 areas/2 reference datasets
- Make separate copies of all notebooks with results
- save folium plots and display them

m1.save("exercise09_example_tesselation.html")
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='exercise09_example_tesselation.html', width=900, height=700)

## Paper

- Output
- Case studies
- Abstract
- Figures

## Code

- Debug momepy simplification!

## Before publishing:

- Update README
    - illustration of workflow
- Add GeoDanmark attribution to all maps with reference example data!

## NICE TO

## SMALL THINGS

- unconnected --> disconnected
- connected component first time, after than just components
- cycling --> bicycle
- EU reference
- remove old/unused test data and saved plots
