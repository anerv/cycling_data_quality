# Questions to be answered in the analysis

## Completeness

- **Density of nodes/edges/attributes (possibly grid-cell based?)**
- **If reference data set available: How 'much' of an area's cycling infrastructure is mapped?**
- Total length/total length of different types of infrastructure
- Development in contributions (spatial heterogeneity!)

## Quality

- **How well is it mapped?**
- Customized simplification: tag diversity; parallel edges etc.
- Differences in network structure
- Differences in routing
- Matching of data sets
- Missing tags
- Number of contributors
- Contribution history

## Regional/local differences

- Point out areas that are possibly more "interesting": e.g. where number of edits is especially high/low, where number of contributors is high/low, where data sets differ strongly (include also: where infrastructure is more sparse?)

## Interpretation and Presentation of results

- Analysis of identified errors/inconsistencies - e.g. spatial clustering/autocorrelation - is there a tendency?
- Autogenerated summary and plots
- e.g. generate a PDF - each page contains a figure and an explanatory text. or keep it in notebook only

# TO-DO

## README

## Config

## Load data

## Intrinsinc Notebooks

- change colors!

## Extrinsic Notebooks

**FRIDAY:**

- cell reach - add about osm being baseline
    - fix plot
- local node/edge ratio --> local average degree
- For the alpha value computation: p = subgraph number is hardcoded to 1, but should rather be the number of disconnected components?  ANE
- merge 03b and 03c

**ASK ANA ABOUT:**

- Colorbar norming: check for uniform norming, especially when centered around 0 ​elaborate?
- Simplification: nr of multiple edges to compute *when*? (for ref data set) ?? **ASK ANVY**
- pct diff

- change colors!

## Summary of findings

- Replicate style, ANE

- Summary plots, for cell reach: I think a percentage would make more sense than an absolute count (solved if we just import the images generated in 03a where I already changed that) ​Replicate, ANE

- Summary notebook, can we export this as PDF? ​Yes

- change colors!

## Feature Matching Notebook

- Add where user configs are used
- polish texts and plots
- references

## Case Studies

- Run the analysis on 2 areas/2 reference datasets
- Make separate copies of all notebooks with results
- save folium plots and display them 

m1.save("exercise09_example_tesselation.html")
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='exercise09_example_tesselation.html', width=900, height=700)

## Paper

- Output
- Case studies
- Abstract
- Figures

## Code

- Debug momepy simplification!

## Before publishing:

- Update README
    - illustration of workflow
- Add GeoDanmark attribution to all maps with reference example data!

## NICE TO

## SMALL THINGS

- unconnected --> disconnected
- connected component first time, after than just components
- cycling --> bicycle
- EU reference
- remove old/unused test data and saved plots
