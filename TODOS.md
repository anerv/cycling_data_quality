# Questions to be answered in the analysis

## Completeness

- **Density of nodes/edges/attributes (possibly grid-cell based?)**
- **If reference data set available: How 'much' of an area's cycling infrastructure is mapped?**
- Total length/total length of different types of infrastructure
- Development in contributions (spatial heterogeneity!)

## Quality

- **How well is it mapped?**
- Customized simplification: tag diversity; parallel edges etc.
- Differences in network structure
- Differences in routing
- Matching of data sets
- Missing tags
- Number of contributors
- Contribution history

## Regional/local differences

- Point out areas that are possibly more "interesting": e.g. where number of edits is especially high/low, where number of contributors is high/low, where data sets differ strongly (include also: where infrastructure is more sparse?)

## Interpretation and Presentation of results

- Analysis of identified errors/inconsistencies - e.g. spatial clustering/autocorrelation - is there a tendency?
- Autogenerated summary and plots
- e.g. generate a PDF - each page contains a figure and an explanatory text. or keep it in notebook only

# TO-DO

## README

## Config

## Load data

## Intrinsinc Notebook

- incompatible tags detail plot
- fix count-bug
- fix dangling nodes density works
- Save Folium plots?

m1.save("exercise09_example_tesselation.html")
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='exercise09_example_tesselation.html', width=900, height=700)

## Extrinsic Notebook

- move data processing
- Add where user configs are used
- make sure that dangling nodes density works!
- Polish texts, references and explanations
- Plots + save plots

## Summary of findings

## Feature Matching Notebook

- Add where user configs are used
- polish texts and plots
- references

## Case Studies

- Run the analysis on 2 areas/2 reference datasets
- Make separate copies of all notebooks with results

## Paper

- Output
- Case studies
- Abstract
- Figures

## Code

- Find a way of saving and displaying folium plots!

## Before publishing:

- Fix **all** plots (make nicer, some folium)
- Write documentation for all functions
- Write the last tests for functions
- Polish text and explanations to notebooks
- Documentation, environment
- Update README
    - illustration of workflow
- Make reference list for notebook refs
- test reproducibility
- somewhere - add MAUP note - not so important with specific values - more their distribution and range
- somewhere - add that feature and edges are used to indicate the same??

## NICE TO

- For merge - check if col already exist - ifx it does - drop

## SMALL THINGS

- unconnected --> disconnected
- connected component first time, after than just components
- cycling --> bicycle
- EU reference
- remove old/unused test data and saved plots


## MERGING

- Look at how dataframes are merged (left or inner?)
- Tagging type - change numbers to letters
- Check that dangling node density works
- Make yml dict with leaf layers
