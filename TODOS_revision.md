## TODOS FINAL

**GENERAL REVISION/CHECKLIST**
* passive voice; typos; OSM/REF in caps; call folium maps "interactive maps" instead of "folium maps"
* all printed numbers are saved and/or plotted
* densities are given in m/km2
* meters and kilometers in figures are always correctly computed, indicated and labelled
* for all comparisons, every cell where at least one of the two (osm, ref) is missing is labelled as "no data" (and not as 0 or +-100%)
* check that .infrastructure_length and .length are used correctly
