* pip install -e . (for having src as a package) only works if i rename the setup_env.py to "setup.env" --> other solutions? (for markdown description OR setup filename)
* "Depending on the size of your study area, getting data through OSMnx can take a little while." --> add how long? "approx 2 mins for cph"
* filenames of images: to discuss - now we have all fig filenames starting with folium_, gpd_ or plt_ but might be not relevant for user - maybe have only 2 different prefixes, 1 for folium (not "folium" but "interactive" or smth like that but shorter) and the other one for plt/gpd ("image" or the like)?
* figsize is now controlled from pdict["fsmap"] etc. (rather than defining an aspect ratio; it's the "shortcut" since we can in that way control the output within the notebook; but we can talk about it to Michael what would make more sense)
* added filepaths for figsaving in results/.../{studyarea} subfolders to paths.py
* discuss figure titles in general (and whether some print statements can be omitted then, e.g. about number of gridcells etc.)
* how is the reference data coverage in sqkm computed? does it make sense to have this (as a different value than the study area?)
* 02a: there is something off with the length in the tag analysis, e.g. "Measured in kilometeres, 541672 out of 1277583 km " --> was there some multiplication where it should have been division by 100 prior in the code?
* 02a: tag analysis percentages: not adding them to the csv export at the moment - to discuss if needed both for edgecount and for km?
