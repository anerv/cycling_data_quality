See below: comments for 01a, 01b, and 02a for sections 1 and 2 (i didn't touch the 2a.3 Network topology section yet)


* i found a way to insert a draggable legend into the folium plots! and very excited about it see the section 02a - Folium plot of tagging types, and /settings/htmllegend.py for a link to a website where it's (kind of) explained plus the html code behind the legend. this could maybe be a "homework" for michael? he might have a good idea on how to insert our python-based specifications of color vs. legend item into the html code. i just filled it with sample colors/legend items for now.

* filenames of images: to discuss - now we have all fig filenames starting with folium_, gpd_ or plt_ but might be not relevant for user - maybe have only 2 different prefixes, 1 for folium (not "folium" but "interactive" or smth like that but shorter) and the other one for plt/gpd ("image" or the like)?

* figsize is now controlled from pdict["fsmap"] etc. (rather than defining an aspect ratio; it's the "shortcut" since we can in that way control the output within the notebook; but we can talk about it to Michael what would make more sense)

* i added filepaths for figsaving in results/.../{studyarea} subfolders to paths.py

* we could discuss figure titles in general (and whether some print statements can be omitted then, e.g. about number of gridcells etc.)

* how is the reference data coverage in sqkm computed? does it make sense to have this (as a different value than the study area?)
(based on the convex hull of the graph, if we are talking about the value in the load data notebooks)


* 02a: tag analysis percentages: not adding them to the csv export at the moment - to discuss if needed both for edgecount and for km?; 02a stats_tags.csv - to discuss if it makes sense (also with the rounding etc.)
* 02a: # @Ana - do we want to plot both the count and length of existing/missing tags? --> not sure about this! but i think it's fine to generate all the images that are there now (and to also show them). what we could talk about is whether to format them a bit differently (maybe different colors?) for length vs. edge count? or just to plot them separately (maybe in 2 separate loops, or within 2 subplots of the same figure) for length vs. edgecount.

* i'm splitting the gpd-generated plots so that they are all independent figures (rather than subplots of 1 figure) so that we can also save and process them independently later on

* tbd: folium background maps - which ones should be there by default, which ones can be made optional? (having several background maps can make it slow to load) 

* your comment on competing tagging patterns: "small multiple plot" --> i didn't get what you mean by that?
I meant that it maybe could be in the style of the plots in the old summary notebook - so they are a bit smaller and all tiled in the same plot... 
maybe it doesn't make sense, but I was thinking that it is the overview/comparison which is more important than having each plot on their own?

* 02a competing tags: for each tag combination, i'm first plotting the grid (with color="none") to get the same map everytime (otherwise geopandas zooms in) - but can maybe also be used to highlight the cells in which there is a competing tag situation? so that the competing tags that appear few times are still visible on the gpd plot). another option would be to replace this with a folium plot with one layer for each competing tagging type combination (if we manage to get the html legend to work :) and add markers etc. --> to discuss
