# For example, if highway = 'cycleway' the feature is mapped as an individual geometry. In this case, the tag 'width', if filled out, describes the width of the cycleway.
# On the other hand, if highway = 'primary' and cycleway = 'track' the cycling infrastructure is mapped as an atttribute to a road centerline and the 'width' tag refers to the main road. In this instance only the 'cycleway_width' columns is of interest.
