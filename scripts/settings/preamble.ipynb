    "This report was automatically generated by BikeDNA (Bicycle Data & Network Assessment). BikeDNA is a tool for assessing the quality of [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and other bicycle infrastructure data sets in a reproducible way. It provides planners, researchers, data maintainers, cycling advocates, and others who work with bicycle networks a detailed, informed overview of data quality in a given area.\n",

    "A fair amount of research projects on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and other forms of volunteered geographic information (VGI) have already been conducted, but few focus explicitly on bicycle infrastructure. Doing so is important because paths and tracks for cyclists and pedestrians often are mapped last and are more likely to have errors ([Barron et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12073), [Neis et al. 2012](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1)). Moreover, the spatial distribution of errors and dips in data quality in crowdsourced data are often not random but correlate with population density and other characteristics of the mapped area ([Forghani and Delavar, 2014](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/2/750)), which necessitates a critical stance towards the data we use for our research, despite the overall high quality of OSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data quality* covers a wide range of aspects. The conceptualization of data quality used here is what is referred to as *fitness-for-purpose* ([Barron et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12073)) - this means that data quality is interpreted as whether or not the data fulfils the user needs, rather than any universal definition of quality. To particularly support network-based research, this tool provides insights into the topological structure of the bicycle network apart from data coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is not to give any final assessment of the data quality, but to highlight aspects that might be relevant for assessing whether the data for a given area is fit for use. While the tool does make use of a reference dataset for COMPARE, if one is available, the ambition is not to give any final assessment of the quality of OSM compared to the reference data. OSM data on bicycle infrastructure is often at a comparable or higher quality than government datasets, and the interpretation of differences between the two thus requires some local knowledge."
